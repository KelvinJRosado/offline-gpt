This is currently an empty repository. Your task is to create a standalone app that will be released as a single executable file. The app is an chat client that allows users to converse with an LLM local to the device. As the LLM is on the device, the big conceit of this app is that it can be used offline.

The app should be able to:

- Connect to an LLM
- Send messages to the LLM
- Receive messages from the LLM
- Display messages in a chat interface
- Allow users to edit the prompt that is sent to the LLM
- Only one model should be supported initially, but the app should be designed to support multiple models in the future.
- The app should come included with a default model that should be small
- The app should be able to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux as a standalone executable
- The app should have a modern UI experience
- The app should be built with Python and any relevant libraries
- Any dependencies should be included in the app, pinned to an exact version in the requirements.txt file
- Support both dark and light mode, with a toggle to switch between them

When building the app keep the following in mind:

- Commit early and often
- Use conventional commit messages
- Keep the codebase clean and well-organized
- Use the latest and greatest Python features
- Use the latest and greatest practices
- Use the latest and greatest patterns
- Add unit tests and ensure that all tests pass before committing
- Make sure to follow the PEP 8 style guide
- Make sure to follow the latest security best practices and ensure that the app is secure
