# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a new repository called "offline-gpt" that appears to be in its initial state with minimal content. The repository contains:

- An empty README.md file
- Claude Code configuration in `.claude/settings.local.json` with restricted bash permissions
- Git repository initialized with a single "Init" commit

## Development Environment

This repository currently has no build system, dependencies, or development commands configured. There are no package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency management files present.

## Architecture

The codebase is currently empty with no source code files. The architecture will need to be established as development progresses.

## Configuration

- Claude Code permissions are configured in `.claude/settings.local.json` with limited bash access (only `cat` and `ls` commands allowed)
- No other configuration files, linting rules, or development tools are currently set up

## Notes for Future Development

- This appears to be a greenfield project that will likely involve GPT/LLM functionality based on the repository name
- Standard development tooling (package managers, testing frameworks, linting) will need to be added as the project develops
- Consider the security implications given the "offline-gpt" name and establish appropriate safeguards
